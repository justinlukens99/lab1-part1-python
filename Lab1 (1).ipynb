    "This is the only assignment that you should work individually rather than with a partner. However, working alongside a partner or study buddy is highly encouraged :)\n",

    "## Using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are interactive tools that let you write and run code, create visualizations, and add notes all in one place, making it easier to learn and share your work. They're great for subjects like math, science, and programming. Content is grouped in cells, which includes **Markdown cells** and **Code cells**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markdown Cells**: Used for text explanations, instructions, or any rich formatting. You can write headings, bullet points, or even embed images.\n",
    "- **Code Cells**: Used for writing and running Python code. You can execute code cell-by-cell to see immediate outputs, debug, and iterate quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll notice two main buttons in VS Code or Jupyter:\n",
    "1. **Run/Play Button** to execute a code cell and see the output below.\n",

    "## What is GitHub Copilot (AI Pair Programmer)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub Copilot** is an AI tool that provides suggestions for your code, similar to how a human \"pair programmer\" might. It can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggest lines or blocks of code based on context,\n",
    "- Offer explanations or docstrings for your functions,\n",
    "- Help brainstorm solutions or alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Use GitHub Copilot**\n",
    "1. **Ask Conceptual Questions**: In comments, type queries like:\n",
    "   - *\"Copilot, can you explain how a function’s return statement works?\"*\n",
    "2. **Generate Code**: Begin typing a function or a comment, and Copilot will offer a suggestion. Accept or reject based on your needs.\n",
    "3. **Iterate & Explore**: Refine your code, ask Copilot to improve efficiency or style, or to handle edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Remember**: Copilot is a **tool**—the logic and understanding must come from **you**. Use Copilot for helpful hints or clarifications, but **ensure you can explain the final code**. If you find yourself copying entire answers from Copilot without understanding them, take a step back and revisit the concept or ask Copilot more targeted questions (e.g., *“Why is this solution correct?”*).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Asking Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask for an explanation in simple terms of object-oriented programming languages such as Python.\n",
    "- Also ask why Python is such a popular programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goal**: You want to learn how to **think** in Python, so use Copilot judiciously for hints or clarifications. Resist asking Copilot to fill in the blanks directly unless you’re truly stuck.\n",
